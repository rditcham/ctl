Q(1): Do you already receive public assistance?
A: Yes
	Q(1.1):GOTO:qualaid
A: No
	Q(house): How many people are in your family/household?
	X:number
		Q(income): How much income does your household bring in per year after tax dollars?
		X[javascript:if (fedpov(getvar('house'),getvar('income'),125)){ goto('qual') } else if (fedpov(getvar('house'),getvar('income'),218)) { goto('qualbut') } else { goto('noqual') } ]:number
Q(qualaid): You probably qualify as indigent because you receive public assistance.

Q(qual): You probably qualify as indigent since you earn less than 125% of the poverty line. Consequently, you may be eligible to have your court fees waived.

Q(qualbut): You probably qualify as indigent but able to contribute since you earn between 125% and 218% of the poverty line. So you'll likely be assigned a lawyer and asked to pay a small fee.

Q(noqual): You probably won't qualify as indigent since you earn more than 125% of the poverty line. So you'll probably need to hire an attorney.
